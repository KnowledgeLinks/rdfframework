Understanding the RDF Application Files
***************************************
The RDF application files define the application using RDF triples. The vocabulary used is a combination of the standard **OWL, RDF, RDFS and XSD** namespaces. These vocabularies are then applied to the namespaces your application is using. Lastly, your classes and properties are enchanced using the **KDS** and **KDR** vocabularies developed by knowledgelinks.io.
